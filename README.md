Plan:
Sprint 0:
MVP finished, project decided

Sprint 1:
Set up environment: React Native, Python Flask backend
First intro to python and react (JS)
Research how to get location data

Sprint 2:
Continue learning
Begin cardio tracker algorithm (determine whether you are running, biking, etc)  (python)

Begin algorithm:
Create sample data:
Python list of data, need time, lat, long
Iterate through the list, calculating velocities?
Use velocities and compare to a threshold to return true or false for biking / walking

Sprint 3:
Finish up cardio tracker algorithm (python)

Sprint 4:  Midterm presentation
Begin front end development (react)
Create location database (python)

Sprint 5:
Continue frontend (displaying activities)
Continue backend (saving activities)

Sprint 6:
Continue frontend (display more specific stats)
Continue backend (log more stats, process data)

Sprint 7:
Continue frontend (display comparison)
Continue backend (calculate differences between activities)

Sprint 8:
Polishing frontend (make it look nice)

Sprint 9: Final presentation
Clean up code, push to master.
